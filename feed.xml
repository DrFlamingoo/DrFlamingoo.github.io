Snapshot, Backups, etc.–everything would be super easy.</p>

<p>But, installing Proxmox on a BTRFS disk is not enough, one has to use the command line to create a LXC container and specify BTRFS as the root filesystem.  Well, I learned about that, when ten containers were already up and running.</p>

<p>This post explores how to migrate the rootfs of an existing LXC container from a raw image (inside: ext4 filesystem) to a btrfs subvolume.  It assumes that Proxmox is installed with the BTRFS disk option, so YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-step</h2>

<p>If your container already exists, migration of its rootfs is actually easy and straightforward. In the following, replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XXX</code> with the container ID.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Shut down the LXC container.</li>
  <li>Find your current rootfs. In case it resides in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local-btrfs</code> you should find it under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/var/lib/pve/local-btrfs/images/XXX/vm-XXX-disk-0/disk.raw</code>. This raw image file contains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ext4</code> root filesystem of your container.

  </li>
  <li>Mount the root filesystem (<a href="https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/how-do-i-mount-a-raw-image.43186/">this forum thread</a> discusses how to do that in detail).

  </li>
  <li>Start up your container and clean up the old root disk.</li>
</ol>

<p>And everything should just work :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just how convenient would it be, if Proxmox containers would use a BTRFS subvolume as a rootfs?

It was also clear, that a fairly powerful AMD CPU would power the system.  So I did the only sensible thing, and installed a gaming VM in a Proxmox Host.
<!--more--></p>

<p>My experience was a little bit of frickling, and a lot of good results, but let’s start at zero:</p>

<h2 id="a-non-windows-gaming-machine">A Non-Windows gaming machine?</h2>

<p>All my notebooks run Linux, usually Arch Linux, and have done so for the last 15 years.  At the same time, all my notebooks are notoriously underpowered, and would barely cope with games.  So I played on my desktop Windows computer, always dreading the switch to Linux gaming.</p>

<p>So, while I had a clear goal set, it took a few years and new hardware to give me the push to at least try.</p>

<p>For the initial test of gaming on Linux, I searched for the shiniest Linux distro I could find, that also marketed towards Gamers. I settled for <a href="https://system76.com/pop/">Pop!_OS</a>, and installed it on an SSD for funsies.
And it worked super well.</p>

<p>I am not a big fan of Ubuntu or flatpak, but if all I do is some gaming, why not? Well, that’s how they get you :-)</p>

<h2 id="a-non-windows-gaming-vm">A Non-Windows gaming VM?</h2>

<p>Now, with my Linux Distro <em>of choice</em>, I was ready to test if I could move the distro to a virtual machine hosted on Proxmox. This would give me the chance to utilize the CPU (and GPU, maybe) in more than one way. Coming from a platform that was mostly CPU bound, 24 core out of 36 for gaming is luxury.</p>

<p>With Proxmox v8.3.5, even the PCI pass-through was super easy. There was a bit of confusion when picking the right approach, and there will be tests for alternatives.</p>

<p>For my Nvidia 970 GTX, these were the possible strategies</p>

<ol>
  <li>VM &amp; vGPU - requires registering into some Nvidia program, but the GPU (don’t even know if mine qualifies) would be shareable between VMs</li>
  <li>VM &amp; PCI pass-through - requires the proper IOMMU kernel modules, and some straightforward configuration in the Proxmox GUI, but the GPU is then bound to a single VM</li>
  <li>LXC &amp; ??? - allows sharing the GPU with other workloads.</li>
</ol>

<p>For me, the third option sounds perfect, but I have not figured out how to create a LXC template container for Pop!_OS, and installing on top of a previous Ubuntu image is unsupported. So, I went with option (2).</p>

<h2 id="moving-steam-libraries--flatpak-magic">Moving Steam Libraries / Flatpak magic</h2>

<p>Flatpak isolates applications from the rest of the system in sandboxes.  So, to move the Steam library base directory off my home directory, access and permissions to the target location needs to be explicitly granted.  The easiest way to do so, is using the software <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Flatseal</code>.</p>

<p>So I</p>
<ol>
  <li>mounted a hard drive at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/sdd</code>,</li>
  <li>allowed the Steam sandbox access to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/mnt/sdd/__games/steam-library</code>,</li>
  <li>configured Steam to expect a library in that folder,</li>
  <li>and finally moved existing game data to that very folder (from the <a href="#a_non_windows_gaming_machine">first try</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Games were detected automatically, saving a few 100 GB of data volume. Yay!</p>

<h2 id="mounting-a-hard-drive-in-vms">“Mounting” a Hard drive in VMs</h2>

<p>So - how to actually mount a drive in a VM? Usually, there is no way to do this except for file sharing over network (NFS or samba), but I did not want to go down that road.</p>

<p>Instead, one can simply pass the whole PCI device through to the VM, from where we then can mount it very easily.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>

<p>I would love to share the graphics card between VMs or containers, but the current setup does not allow for that. I do like the idea of an LXC container for gaming (also sharing the Proxmox Kernel, maybe not the best idea?!), but for me and my limited time there is no way to figure out how to build a non-standard LXC template.</p>

<p>So, maybe run a more standard distro for gaming? Yes, but I am hooked on the ease of Pop!_OS for now.  Maybe this is sth to try if I finally do buy a new graphics card :)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a new desktop computer, it was clear from the start, that I would never run Windows on that machine.

There have been multiple strategies to manage this collection in the last 13 years.
In fact, much of my hardware exists in order to host the files.</p>

<p>Lately, great self-hosting solutions to access your photos online have been created, and after some experimenting I have landed on <a href="https://www.immich.app">immich</a>.
Here, I include my DSLR archive as an external library - immich does not care for the layout, and I can have it the way I like it.</p>

<p>In order to import to the DSLR archive, I use something like the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>exiftool <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="nt">-verbose</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="nt">-recurse</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="nt">-dateFormat</span> <span class="s1">'%Y/%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="s1">'-FileName&lt;${model}/${CreateDate} - ${model} - ${FileName;s/[I_]MG_//;s/[.](CR2|JPG)//;}.%le'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	/source/path/ <span class="se">\</span>
	/archive/path/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This copies all files found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/source/path/</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/archive/path</code>, creating a folder hierarcy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/archive/path/$model/$year/</code> and renaming the files to include creation date, the camera model as well as the running number.</p>

<p>Neat.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, I have two Canon DSLR and one Canon SLR bodies, and have accumulated about 100k photos.
