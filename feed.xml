There have been multiple strategies to manage this collection  in the last 13 years.
In fact, much of my hardware exists in order to host the files.</p>

<p>Lately, great self-hosting solutions to access your photos online have been created, and after some experimenting I have landed on <a href="https://www.immich.app">immich</a>.
Here, I include my DSLR archive as an external library - immich does not care for the layout, and I can have it the way I like it.</p>

<p>In order to import to the DSLR archive, I use something like the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>exiftool <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="nt">-verbose</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="nt">-recurse</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="nt">-dateFormat</span> <span class="s1">'%Y/%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	<span class="s1">'-FileName&lt;${model}/${CreateDate} - ${model} - ${FileName;s/[I_]MG_//;s/[.](CR2|JPG)//;}.%le'</span> <span class="se">\</span>
	/source/path/ <span class="se">\</span>
	/archive/path/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This copies all files found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/source/path/</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/archive/path</code>, creating a folder hierarcy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/archive/path/$model/$year/</code> and renaming the files to include creation date, the camera model as well as the running number.</p>

<p>Neat.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[By now, I have two Canon DSLR and one Canon SLR bodies, and have accumulated about 100k photos.
